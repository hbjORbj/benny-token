# Development of my own cryptocurrency on Ethereum from Scratch

> Token's name is "Benny Token", and it is an ERC-20 token: meaning that it follows the rules all Ethereum-based tokens must follow and it is issued on the Ethereum network instead of running on its own blockchain.

> Token built from scratch without using public libraries except for SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin

> Token is written in Solidity, and tests and frontends are written in JavaScript
